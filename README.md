# datascience_study
Files with some of the Data Science techniques I learned to use. Can be usefull to lookup more possible ways to treat similar business problems or to get in idea of possible conslusions you potentially could get out from similar data.
All proyects were done by me for a Data Science postgraduate program at IEBS School in Spain. 
The biggest one is the final yearly proyect. In some cases it has poorly described logic why I was prefering one tool or algorythm over another, but does show my habilities to experiment, code, approach tasks and get the results.
