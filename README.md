Files with some of the Data Science techniques I learned to use. Can be usefull to lookup more possible ways to treat similar business problems or to get in idea of possible conslusions you potentially could get out from similar data.
All proyects were done by me for a Data Science postgraduate program at IEBS School in Spain. 

The biggest one is the final yearly proyect is ¨TF_GlobalProject_ML_NLP_Text_Modeling_TETIANA_IANIUK.pdf¨. There is also a file with only code part named in a similar mask. 
This proyect was amed to search for the best possible approach for short cunsumer opinions summurization in spanish language for marketing purposes. After some reasearch on possible approches I classified the problem as a Extractive text summarization task. The main goal of the extractive method is to maintain the original parts of the text, not to generate a new frase as would be done with a generative text summarization methods.

I didn't focuse on a explanation on why I was prefering one tool or algorythm over another, but really did a good state of the art reasearch, experimented with simpliest and the most complicated ways to approach the task and got the results. 

All data used and exposed is either public or a permittion of the data owner was gotten for the purpose of publication of the files in the container.
